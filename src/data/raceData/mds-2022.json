  "fullDescription": "<p>The Marathon des Sables is a legendary multi-stage ultramarathon held annually in the Sahara Desert of Morocco. The race spans approximately 250 kilometers (155 miles) over 6 stages, with runners required to carry all their own food, sleeping gear, and supplies.</p>\n    <p>Each participant carries a backpack containing all essential survival equipment, food, and personal items. The only assistance provided is limited water rations and tents to sleep in at night. The harsh desert conditions include temperatures that can exceed 50°C (122°F) during the day and drop dramatically at night.</p>\n    <p>The course traverses a variety of desert terrain including sand dunes, rocky plains, mountains, and dried river beds. The longest single stage, known as the \"long march,\" typically covers around 80-90km and must be completed in one continuous effort.</p>",
  "experience": "This was my first self-supported stage race and easily the most challenging race I've ever completed. The combination of extreme heat, sand dunes, and carrying all supplies created a unique physical and mental challenge. The camaraderie among participants was incredible, with everyone supporting each other through the toughest moments.",
  "challenges": "The biggest challenges were managing water consumption in 45°C heat, dealing with severe blisters after stage 3, and the mental fatigue during the 86km long stage that took me over 20 hours to complete.",
